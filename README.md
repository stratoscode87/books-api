# Your book review service

Develop the following service using a language of your choice between [Go, Python, PHP].
You're free to use any framework and library, but be prepared to have to explain your choices!

Make the service easy to run either using a script, a Dockerfile or writing the commands in a documentation file.
And make sure to write some tests!

Use git for version control and publish this exercise as a public repository on a platform like github, but please do not leave references to the company

## Instructions

We have included a simple compose file to make it easy to run some support services that you could need, but feel free to change or use something else completely.

To use it you need to have Docker installed, then you can run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

In this project you must use and integrate some calls from the OpenLibrary API.

You can find more details here: [openapi.org](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)

## Endpoints

```http
GET /search?{keywords}
```

- Search on openlibrary, give back the work_id (and whatever seems appropriate) of matches

```http
POST /review
```

```json
{
  "work_id": "",
  "review": "text",
  "score": 6
}
```

- Validation (check the work_id matches on openlibrary, score range, review characters)
- Save the request to give back a reference for async processing
- Save on DB the complete data (asynchronously, enrich the data via openlibrary with cover image, metadata, etc.)

```http
GET /review/{id}
```

- will reply with 202 while it's processing
- will reply with 200 and your enriched data when everything is ready

```http
PUT /review/{id}
```

```http
DELETE /review/{id}
```

## Misc

It will be appreciated if you want to implement a login system.

feel free to add everything you think is useful and necessary for writing good quality code: automatic tests, static code analysis, automation of coding standard etc.
